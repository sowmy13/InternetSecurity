 MIRAI BOTNET
Mirai is malware that infects smart devices that run on ARC processors, turning them into a network of remotely controlled bots
or zombies. This network of bots, called a botnet, is often used to launch DDoS attacks.

Mirai is built for two core purposes:

Locate and compromise IoT devices to further grow the botnet.
Launch DDoS attacks based on instructions received from a remote C&C.

Miraiâ€™s attack function enables it to launch HTTP floods and various network (OSI layer 3-4) DDoS attacks. 
When attacking HTTP floods, Mirai bots hide behind the following default user-agents:
